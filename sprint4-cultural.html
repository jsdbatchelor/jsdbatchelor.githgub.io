        <h2>ow understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>h

	It helps people harness more of their brain power.
	The more a neurological pathway is used, the stronger it gets 		this reduces anxiety, as tasks/thoughts/habits are familiar.

Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit

	Repetition seems to be the core to neuroplasicity. Also to be 			able 	to consciously understand what your brain is physically 			doing.

What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
	
	Focus on single tasks and repeat them, if you have too many 		ideas or thoughts then it is harder to form a pathway.

	Realise you brain needs more than to type. Moving, taking	 		breaks, water, exercise, and eating well and regularly

	For mindfulness I use the apps, Headspace and Calm.

2.Research Growth Mindset
Discuss what it is and why it is relevant

	Essentially, if you believe in something enough you can 				achieve it.

	Reinforcing the neurological pathways, with positive but 			realistic praise will help reprogram the brain to run more 			efficiently, or in our case happier.

In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?

	Yes, the power you have to understand how the different areas 	of brain work and how to use it its quite incredible.
	
	The importance of repetition. I knew it is important, but didn’t 		understand how it physically affected the brain.

How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
	
	I think “Growth Mindset”, will be crucial for bootcamp. It should 		be one of the tools assessed each day and ask myself, how 			have I used this knowledge/skill to make me a better 				programmer ?
