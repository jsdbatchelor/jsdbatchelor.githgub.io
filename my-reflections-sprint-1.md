# Command Line Primer 

<!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
The command line allows one to input text in order to process commands on the computer. 


### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
Yes i managed to be within the timebox guidelines.


### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do
git clone creates a clone of a repository
git checkout switches current branch
git branch creates a new branch
cd changes current file
git commit saves changes to a local repository


# Install and Explore Git 

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
GitHub is an online service that developers can use to upload and change code whereas git is a version control tool that is located on your local machine which helps manages different versions of edited code.


### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?



### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
The workshop video explained most of the content required so it was mostly okay but for the moments which i wasnt sure what to do i managed to google and find the answer.


### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
Take a bit more time learning about git and its commands.



# Branch, Pull, Merge

<!-- Copy your reflection answers into this file -->

### What is Master?
Master is the main branch of the code.


### Why create a Branch?
Creatine a branch allows one to edit a clone of the master branch without actually editing anything on that master branch and when they feel like they have done work that they can finally put onto the master branch they can then do so.


### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  
Commit is like the final confirmation box that appears when you buy something online, you can put all your details in but nothing will be changed unless you commit.


# GitHub Fork & Clone

<!-- Answer the following questions -->

### What are some examples of when you would fork?
When you want to suggest a change to someones work you could fork their repository make the changes and discuss with them if the new changes would be good.



### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
As i continued on with the tasks and got more use to pulling and pushing using git i started to understand it alot more.




# Setup Repo & Create Blog

### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
This activity was good and required me to really remember and understand what i had done previously in order to complete it.


### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
I didnt really know how websites were created before doing this so this was really interesting to learn about and to learn about all the different things a simple computer can achieve.




# Thinking like a programmer

### What is your process so far for solving problems?
I usually give them a good try and try to get it done however if my time is running out ill often use google in order to find the solution. 




# Introduce yourself

### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
Good its a lot different to introducing yourself in person. 


### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
I dont think i was that self conscious when doing it as it is so detached from actually being there and introducing yourself to them so you dont really feel that self conscious.
